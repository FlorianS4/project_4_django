## User Experience
### User Stories
#### First Time User
- I want to read reviews about games I'm interested in.
- I want to read what other people think about my favorite game.
- I'm looking for a new game to play and hope to find inspiration on this site.

#### Returning User

- I want to wirte comments with my own thoughts about a game that somebody wrote a blog post for.

#### Frequent User

## Design
### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following font:
- ![Lato font image](/docs/readme-images/font-image-navbar.png)

    [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Gamecrit)
- Lato font was picked because I like the look of it for the Gamecrit header in the Navbar.

- ![Stencil font image](/docs/readme-images/font-image-banner.png)

    [Stencil](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Stardos+Stencil?preview.text=GAMECRIT&query=Stencil)
- Stencil was picked as font for my Banner heading.

- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case the main font is not imported into the website, or there is a problem with the browser.

### Imagery

All Images were taken from different websites. I give credit to them in the [credits](#credits) section. I only needed two pictures, one as a default picture if people forgot or didn't want to include a picture for their blog post. The other picture is for the Gamecrit Banner.

### Color Scheme

* I have used `#FFFFFF` and `#000000` as the primary color for text used on the site.
* I have used `#910C07` as the text color for the "crit" in the navbar header.
* I have used `#C2B329` as the background color for the navbar and the author display.
* I have used `#D3D3D3` as the background color for the blog text field and for the comment section.
* I have used `#2CFF05` as the color for for the buttons on my site.
