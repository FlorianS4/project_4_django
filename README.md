## Site Owner Goals
- 

## User Experience
### User Stories
#### First Time User
- 

#### Returning User
- 

#### Frequent User
- 

## Design
### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Rajdhani font image](/assets/docs/readme-images/google-font-for-h.png)

    [Rajdhani](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rajdhani?preview.text=Halo%20Memory%20Game&query=Rajdhani) was chosen for my headings.
- ![Inconsolata font image](/assets/docs/readme-images/google-font-for-body.png)

    [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?preview.text=Halo%20Memory%20Game&query=Inconsolata) was chosen for my body.
- I picked both those fonts, because they reminded me of the fonts used in Halo.
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case the main font is not imported into the website, or there is a problem with the browser.

### Imagery

All Images were taken from different websites. I give credit to them in the [credits](#credits) section. The images selected show different characters from the Halo Universe.

### Color Scheme

* I have used `#000000` as the primary color for text used on the site.
* I have used `#8EA72F` as the background color.
* I have used `#9B9B9B` as the placeholder text color for the input field.
* I have used `#374E95` as the color for the hover functions on the buttons.
